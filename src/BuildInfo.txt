Installed the latest (5.0 at the time) clang from their ppa. Then, I followed these instructions for building locally:

https://libcxx.llvm.org/docs/BuildingLibcxx.html

This compiled cleanly when including the coroutine header, but it isn't actually linking against the correct libc++ lib.

clang++-5.0 -std=c++17 -stdlib=libc++ main.cpp -o consumer.out -nostdinc++ -I"/home/kael/code/OpenSource/llvm/projects/libcxx/include/" -fcoroutines-ts


CC=clang-5.0
CXX=clang++5.0
